AITA for making my wedding alcohol free ?,"I can't actually believe people got mad over this but here we go. 

I recently got married to my wonderful husband. We had a Muslim wedding and had a very fun wedding part or so I thought.
I am Muslim now because I converted before mariage but I was born and raised a Catholic, so I had a lot of Christian friends. I never liked alcohol I always said "" it burns, it tastes bad and it makes me sick"" so always avoided events like parties and such with them. I always had toc are for their messy selves after parties where that had too much. 

When it come to my wedding I specifically put on the invites ""no alcohol will be served on the day off"" 
A lot of my friends asked me why and I told them all the reasons above also I am marrying in a Muslim family so I think it would be disrespectful. 

I thought everything was great but on my wedding day as I was circling the tables during lunch time I noticed that two tables had expensive wines, whiskeys, and other very expensive liquor bottles. 
I was shook , angry and scared that my new relatives would see it so I asked the servers to quietly take them away from the tables and make sure no alcohol is served anymore and to pour the rest of the bottles in the sinks. 

Maybe 30minutes later one of my male christian friends let's call him Adam came to me visibly pissed off. He told me he had brought expensive alcohol and can't find the bottles anywhere and the others told him they were taken away I told him what happened above and he got quiet and said he had to leave. 

When I came back from my honeymoon. I saw an envelope taped to my door. When me and my husband opened it, it had an invoice for all the bottles that were at my wedding. I was shook and called Adam asking him WTF ? He said I should pay for the bottles I made the servers pour and I refused because I already said before hand No Alcohol. He called me an asshole for inviting christian friends and not letting them having alcohol and for not paying for the waste.


AITA for having an alcohol free wedding ?? Can't people have fun without it ?

Info : why didn't I just tell Adam to leave with his booze? Adam is my close friend's husband he got into the friend group after their wedding. We always try not to inconvenience him because he throws fits and specially when he drinks. That day I actually was surprised he didn't say anything and just left. 

Update: a few comments in and my husband has also been reading them and we will be paying for the bottles as we have the means to. I agree that it was an overreaction from my part",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h5qf2/aita_for_making_my_wedding_alcohol_free/,167,1.8,92.8
AITA for making my baby laugh at a restaurant,"It was my wife's birthday yesterday.  She picked out a mid tier restaurant to go to for her birthday.  This was no chili's level but not high end either.  We went at 5:30 on a Wednesday, so not that busy.    


We have a 10 month old who's just about the happiest kid ever.  Nearly anything I do makes him laugh. Well at dinner I was making him laugh.  He'd throw in some happy yelling.  Maybe got a touch loud but he was in a great mood. 

  
Well the table next to us had an issue with what I was doing and asked me to stop.  They told us to keep it down.  I'm like he's laughing thats all.  Him laughing is an issue?  They just repeat that he is too loud, if he is going to be like this they suggested we stay home.  I tell them to leave us alone and continue making my son laugh.  I overheard them reference me as an asshole.  They requested to move tables and did.  But was I the asshole for making my baby laugh?  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h4tpt/aita_for_making_my_baby_laugh_at_a_restaurant/,93,2.4,38.8
AITA for telling my sister she chose to have kids and she has to deal with the consequences of that herself?,"
I (27F) go out with my sister (Lilly - 35F) once every two or three months for lunch. That is both because she has 3 kids (8F 5M 2F)and barely has time and because I have very few days to myself thanks to my residency.

Throughout this whole lunch, for the past few years she has complained nonstop about how hard it is to have kids and be a mom. Nonstop. She talks about kids 100% of the time and complains.

I was extra tired during our last lunch and I lashes out at her, saying that I don't remember anyone forcing her to have kids and now that she had them, she should be a big girl and deal with the consequences of her actions and decisions.

She got super mad, called me a judgemental AH who knew nothing about parenthood. I was like exactly, I'm taking one of the modt challenging paths a person can take in my career and I've never complained. Not even a word because I chose it myself.

She told me I was a horrible sister and an even worse aunt, said she wanted nothing to do with an AH like me. Aita?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h4few/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_chose_to_have_kids/,241,2.6,92.7
"AITA for removing a fellow teacher from our school district adult choir because she really can’t sing, even though she was a founding member 25 years ago?","Edit: please read rule 2 so this doesn’t get buried by the Reddit algorithm.


For background, I am in a school district that because of growth has gone from 1 school in the late 90s to over 20 now. Most of us are newer teachers but there are a few that have been around since the very early days. This is the case with “Brenda.” 

In the late 90s a group of teachers started an adult choir completely for fun. That group has expanded and held on every year (except pandemic of course, but we did still try to meet over zoom) and now we are actually a really solid choir and we enter competitions across the country. I have been the director for 4 years. Brenda was the only one of the original founders left in the choir.

The problem is Brenda can’t sing. She loves to sing but she can’t do it. And since the focus of our choir has shifted from just “fun” to actually making music, I have informed Brenda that she is no longer welcome to practice and perform with us. 

I thought I was doing the right thing because everyone knows Brenda can’t sing and for years people have complained about not wanting to be next to her because it ruins their pitch or having to shuffle brenda around so her voice can be covered up. What actually happened is I started an s-storm and people are furious with me and Brenda apparently has gone from being a very happy working in the curriculum department to now saying she may retire mid year as this “the last insult” she has to endure as a teacher. Behind my back my people are calling me mean, dictator, f-ist, you name it. 

I was truly trying to make us better and more competitive as a singing group and had no bad intentions. AITA?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h2dwu/aita_for_removing_a_fellow_teacher_from_our/,122,4.1,29.8
AITA for telling my brother not to bring his oldest kid to my house?,"I was estranged from my brother for years even though we lived 5 miles apart. I knew he had three kids and I only met the oldest boy ""Dane"" when he was like 2. A few years ago it came to my attention that my brother was going through a really tough time personally and financially and was fundamentally a single dad to an 8, 5 and 2yo.

I reached out and offered him money so he wouldn't lose his home and he accepted. That led to us reconnecting although I reconnected with my nephews who are now 13, 10 and 7. My brother works weekends and I happily agreed to watch his kids. It's no skin off my back. I've always worked from home and get paid a lot of money to do very little work during the week so it's not a big deal to give up my weekends.

Dane has gotten more and more distant from me and he admitted that he doesn't want to come over to my house on the weekends anymore. He'd prefer to stay home alone until his dad comes home. I thought it was a great idea and it's better than having a passive aggressive teenager who hates being in your house.

I asked Dane if he wanted me to talk to his dad and he said he didn't care. I spoke to my brother and said what would be the harm in letting Dane stay at home while you're at work and the younger two are with me? I often leave Dane alone at my place and it didn't burn down.

He and I argued for an hour over it. I said I didn't understand his reluctance because I don't live too far away if there is an emergency, everyone has a phone and my brother even has a camera in all the rooms. 

He said he wasn't even comfortable with trying it so I said then don't bother bringing him to my house on the weekend. I'll just bring him back home if he wants. He accused me trying to dictate how he parents and I said someone has to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h2cv1/aita_for_telling_my_brother_not_to_bring_his/,136,4.1,33.2
AITA for bringing up that i didnt agree with my partner smoking weed in a family trip when we were meant to quit together?,"Since getting pregnant, we decided we would both quit weed and tobacco, because its easier to quit together.  

Its been really hard for us both, he has the occasional beer in the evening to help him sleep but i have had nothing and i have been finding it really hard to sleep. I have been having really awful vivid nightmares pretty much every single night and it has been a real test to my willpower quitting everything at once. 

We went to visit his brother, its been like a year since they saw each other face to face. His brother still smokes bud. On the first night brother asked him if he would like to try his new pipe. He tried it. I didnt say anything. After all, brother asked him if he wanted a hit, so i thought id seem like a real dick if i held that against him.

Second day, partners neice comes round with her new baby. Whole family has cuddles. Brother says hes going upstairs (to hit his bong) and my partner asks if he could have a hit, too, so they both go upstairs. 

Partner comes down looking really blazed and asks if I'm ok. I simply say its really hard because i feel like im quitting on my own but that i dont want to discuss it now as neice is over with the baby and this is their moment. 

He keeps asking if I'm ok and do I want to talk, but i say not right now as neice is over now and we can talk about it later. 

Apparently while im out the room, brother's partner mentions that i seem upset, and once neice leaves, my partner apologises for making me feel bad. I just say its been really hard for me to quit everything as i havent really been sleeping. We talk about why that is  and i say i have no problem with him having a drink with his brother. Even them having a pre planned trip in a few weeks where they will go and take shrooms (that i picked) just that smoking has been hard for me to quit especially as he said we would do it together.


Today we had an argument, and he tells me i should have just go let his brother and him hit the bong when they wanted as they haven't seen each other in a year and that i made him feel like an asshole for smoking and that ruined the visit. That he isnt the pregnant one so he doesnt have to quit anything, and that i made the whole thing uncomfortable especially that brother and his partner noticed that i was upset, the focus shouldnt have been on me but on neice and her new child. 

Am i the asshole?

To add: he was actually the first one to bring up quitting and assured me we would be doing it together. He even went out and gave our remaining bit of weed to a friend, and i didnt even ask him or tell him to do that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h1xjk/aita_for_bringing_up_that_i_didnt_agree_with_my/,88,4.4,20.0
