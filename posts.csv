"AITA for making my oldest pay back a 3,000 dollar dress she ruined","My oldest ( Bethany 16) has a step sibling ( Maria 14 almost 15). Bethany and I are white while my husband and Maria are Mexican descent  They have been in each other lives since they were 6 and 7 and overall the relationship is good until recently. Maria quinceanera is coming up and my husband and his ex wife took her to get her dress.

The dress and alliterations came to around 3000 dollars. My daughter has been very jealous of the whole party. I’ve informed her it is part of the culture just like when she had a huge sweet sixteen party with her friends. I spent more time with her to try to make her feel better about it and got her own much cheaper dress for the party. 

The party is suppose to be in two weeks but my daughter after an argument with Maria about the tv she scribbled sharpie all of the expensive dress and ripped the back. The story short everyone was pissed.

I gave money to my husband and his ex to try to get a new dress ASAP. I informed my daughter she will need to get a job and pay back the full price of the dress as punishment.

We got in a huge argument over it and the whole situation isn’t fair that I am choosing Maria and being a huge jerk. Am I being a huge jerk.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17j8whz/aita_for_making_my_oldest_pay_back_a_3000_dollar/,129,1.7,75.9
AITA for telling my daughter I don't understand why she is the way she is?,"My daughter, who is 23 years old, was laid off from her job 2 months ago. She's done some interviews since then but they haven't seemed to pan out and/or she is waiting on them to get back to her with next steps.

Today, she was eating half a bagel and she would leave and go to her room halfway through eating, continuously. I asked her, ""Why do you do that; why can't you just sit there and eat until you're done?""

She got angry and defensive and generally, I don't understand why she seems so depressed and angry all the time.

She tells us that she's ""grieving"" over a career path in college that did not work out and wants to go get tested for ADHD and learning disabilities to see if that's why she didn't cut it in college. 

She also wants to see a therapist to get DBT so she can regulate her grief better, but her dad and I aren't sure we agree with that.

I mean, we have experienced grief before; we lost our other kid and it was hell. I cried every day for 2 years, but you know, I still went to work and busted my butt and got promoted while I was still grieving. 

I told her that time softens the blow and you just have to accept it, and my daughter didn't seem to accept it. If she's not willing to accept that, she can go and take classes again to get back to her original career path. 

I mean, maybe she's just trying to get as many people to help her as possible, but I don't agree with the way she does things.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17j8kus/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_i_dont_understand/,168,1.9,88.4
AITA for not stopping doing things just because it makes the neighbours kids uncomfortable?,"By explaining this issue, it will make sense, and your judgement is much appreciated!

I (23F) live next door to a married couple (47M + 33F) and their six kids (6 - 13 m + F). All of the kids have been diagnosed with autism and they're all introverts and are very shy and uncomfortable around people.

The thing is I'm a postgraduate student, and I work so I'm never at home, but when I am, it's usually when all the kids get home from school, and that's when I tend to start doing my business like washing the windows on the outside, gardening and just some maintenance. 

Most of the time I'm home, I will often go out in my garden and just take my laptop and anything I need with me and just spend a few hours doing any work that I need to complete for my postgraduate. This is what brings us to the current issue. My neighbour recently came around and asked if we could have a chat and I let her in. She said she knows that I know her kids are autistic and she said the problem is her kids are very shy and uncomfortable with people. She then proceeded to say that they often want to play in their garden when they get home from school but the issue is they're too uncomfortable and scared because I'm always in mine to play in theirs and intimidating baring in mind I'm 5""6 and 55kg. I said to her I apologise to her that her kids feel that way but I'm not going to stop doing what I'm doing just because I make them feel uncomfortable.

I spoke to a friend about this today and she thought I was being an asshole about this situation which has got me wondering if I'm an asshole so I'm hoping your judgement could clear it up.

"AITA for kicking my husband out when he said ""Everyone has a workwife these days, it's sad that you don't.""","Basically what the title says but here's some context.

So me (24F) and my husband (24M) met in second year of college and got married after college. I had only come to this country for graduation and stayed because I got a good job and a boyfriend. As much as I love being here, in new environment, I never felt comfortable adopting western trends and practices. I was always a bit conservative and my husband had absolutely no problem with it. He was happy swapping out bar hangouts and getting drunk with a quiet night in the house. 

I also never had any reason to suspect that he might be unfaithful. Although all his office stories, or at least most of it, revolved around a girl, ""Amy."" Again, never thought much of it.

Yesterday, while he was getting ready for his office, he got a call and it was named ""Workwife ♥️."" Now that shocked me beyond belief. I'm usually not the one to snoop around but I opened their chat and there were a lot of hearts and nicknames involved. This hurt me a lot and I immediately confronted him about it. He first got defensive and then slowly calmed down as I kept pushing.

He said and I quote ""Everyone has work wives these days and it's sad that you don't have one (work husband, I assume?).""

He had a very condescending tone and again, I got very upset. If I wanted a ""work husband"" I could easily get one. But of course, I don't because I'll consider it a disrespect to my partner. I just kicked him out with his work bag and he didn't come back home for the night.

When I told this to my friends (who are natives there), they said that I'm the AH for making a big deal out of nothing. They said it's a common thing to do these days and it doesn't necessarily mean that he is cheating or intends to. After mulling over it, I do feel that's the case. I've tried calling him and texting but he just sent one text that said that he needs space. What do y'all think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17j82vk/aita_for_kicking_my_husband_out_when_he_said/,268,2.3,116.5
