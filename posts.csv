AITA for not letting the wronged wife yell at my cheating daughter?,"Ok, my daughter, 23, had an affair with a 30 old man with a wife and 2 kids. She knows I don't think this is the greatest thing. Anyway, daughter lives with me and the wife, who has been showing up places my daughter is and causing scenes, comes to my house! She knocked on my door and asked where my ***** of a daughter was. I told her to leave and while I feel bad for her, she can go yell at her husband and leave my daughter alone, and if she didn't leave I'll have her arrested. I also filed a police report. My other daughter, 20, is super mad about this, and the wife is telling people I know, including my elderly grandma, that I helped my kid try to steal her husband. She looked them up on FB and google I guess. So now everyone is in an uproar and half think I'm a horrible person. I just don't want crazy people at my door or distressing elderly family members. Younger daughter suggested I post here. AITA?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hauj3/aita_for_not_letting_the_wronged_wife_yell_at_my/,131,1.0,131.0
AITA for wanting my daughter to leave her boyfriend cause I think she deserves better,"Hello everyone,

My (F52) daugther (F16) has been dating her boyfriend (M16) for about four years now. They have been close friends since kindergarted and she started crushing strongly on him four years ago and the started dating after a couple of months. Now I just dismissed it as a kid thing, they'd break up, move on, date other people, etc.

However recently I have been getting concerned. The reason being that my daughter deserves better and can do better. Now her boyfriend is a nice boy, all of that. But I just know she can do so much better.

Here is the thing, my boyfriend (M50) and I raised our daughter with high expectations and she has delivered. And no, we are not abusing her; she genuinly enjoys being a high achiever. She is smart, has numerous talents, a strong leader, social with a good friend network, loved by peers and teachers alike - the complete package that everyone wishes that their kids were. Not exagerating, people have said that they wish their daughter was like mine. So of course I also always expected her to have a boyfriend to similliar to her. A high performer, strong academic achiever, probably athletic and talented in other ways, strong resumé with a great future. 

But this is not what is going on. My daughter is on track to achieving a high quality education, likely working as a certified professional of some kind. Her boyfriend? General studies, fowllowed by generic job, maybe teaching?, etc. Now I think it is especially important for a woman to find a partner who earns at leat around what she does as it would not be fair for her to earn plus also carry and birth the kid and do most work raising it (cause lets face it us women do the bulk of it whatever men may say). And I think everyone who is a high achiever should have high expectations in a partner. Her older brother (M20) for example understands as dating someone approaching his level of ambition and intelligence. 

I tried explaining all this to my daughter but she got mad and told me that «I don't understand» and that «we love each other» and how much they are together. She then biked away to her boyfriend's house (where she has a habit of hanging out) and refuses to come home. I then got a call from the boyfriend's mom yelling at me for «insulting her son». Which I am not doing, I just want my daughter to find a good partner worthy of her",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hafh3/aita_for_wanting_my_daughter_to_leave_her/,78,1.3,60.0
AITA for not moving my car out of a private driveway right away?,"I my two sisters and their kids planned a weekend trip at an airbnb. I live abroad and my sisters live far away from one another. This was a special trip we were all looking forward to.

  
My sister Meg and I were driving to the airbnb & were to arrive about 15 minutes before check-in time. Airbnb was directly off a 35 mph road. When I saw the house number on the mailbox, I turned into the driveway which split off to the right, where there was a steep gravel driveway with 3 cars in it, & to the left, where there was a longer paved driveway. I pulled into & turned around in the paved driveway to let Meg pull in off the road.  
I idled for a minute or two, then drove down further towards Meg. She told me that the cars in the gravel driveway were the cleaning people & they would be leaving soon. I turned my car off to wait for them to leave.

  
A woman comes down the driveway I’m parked at the bottom of & starts talking to me. This is the conversation (paraphrased):  
Woman: Excuse me guys? You’re blocking my driveway, this is a private driveway.  
Me: Hey I’m sorry, we got a little turned around.  
W: Well where are you trying to go?  
M: Just right there. They’re leaving soon so I’ll move as soon as I can.   
W: Can you move your car? This is a private driveway.  
M: oh sorry, am I blocking your way, did you need to get out right now?  
W: Could you just move your car?  
M: I would love to, I'm just going right there and I’ll move as soon as possible.  
She then storms away yelling “god dammit, every fucking time!”

  
Meg and I leave her driveway within 3-4 minutes. About 20 minutes later, we receive a message from the airbnb host telling us to leave the property within one hour.

  
The neighboring woman had called the host saying I was rude and aggressive to the point where she wanted to call the police. We tried to explain by message what actually happened but they wouldnt budge. Two women (one being who I spoke with) suddenly came down their driveway and began shouting.

  
They said that I am a bitch, that I had no right, that I was aggressive and rude and impolite, repeatedly telling me it was my fault, said my family can blame me for ruining their weekend. The private property sign was written vertically on a small post and there was another sign in the bushes. Didn’t see it.

  
We tried our hardest to be kind & agree, we apologised profusely, tried to empathise. We ended up leaving. The host told us if we didn’t he would involve the cops.

  
One of the cleaning ladies was still there while this was happening, heard and saw everything. She too was shocked and offered her support if we needed a witness.

  
I messaged the host to see if I could explain our point of view since he didn’t let us before. He responded saying he has all the evidence he needs and this requires no further discussion.

  
Our weekend was ruined. We stayed in a shitty hotel & I was really affected by their words. I could have been nicer with the woman but I don’t know if we deserved to get kicked out.

AITA for telling my boyfriend that I don’t want to take care of his son anymore?,"My boyfriend(30) has a son(6), when we started our relationship he was 2. His mother didn’t want me to be involved in the care of their child, and she and I have never really seen eye-to-eye. In the beginning, it went really well and his son was here every other week, but the older he got the less time he was with his mom and he’s with us 100% now since his mom was arrested a year ago.In the beginning, we divided the chores and child care equally. 4 months ago my boyfriend got an opportunity to work on 3 projects, which could lead him to a big promotion.

He’s always working late, either from home or in the office. I’ve been doing all the chores and childcare since then. I cook, clean, get his son ready in the morning, and drop him off at daycare. The only thing my boyfriend has to do is get his son ready for bed.I told him last Friday that from Monday on I won’t be doing the childcare anymore. He got angry, he said that we’re a family and we need to support each other. He told me he needed me right now and that I just need to be patient.I replied saying that this is his son and he needed to do the majority of the childcare. 

I’ve been doing all of it and it’s not fair since he is his father.He then went into the other room, got his son, and told his son that “Mommy says she doesn’t want to take care of you anymore” while pointing at me. I said to not call me that because I’m not his mother and his son started crying. I of course comforted and apologized to his son, because it wasn’t my intention to upset him.My boyfriend is still mad and has been taking care of his son, but won’t speak to me. 

I didn’t think this was unreasonable, he is the parent and needs to do more of the child care. And also the mom doesn’t even want me to be involved in child care, so I’m already overstepping her wishes. My sister is on his side and says I’m at fault since he and I are a family now, and he needs my support right now. And that the mother’s wishes don’t matter at all right now. Like I don't think this was at all unreasonable, but I’m not sure if I was unreasonable here, AITA?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h9d88/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_i_dont_want_to/,544,2.0,272.0
AITA for Not Wanting My BF to Buy an In-Game Video Game Cosmetic Skin?,"I 25 F and my bf 21 M had a small argument but it’s still picking at me. Him and I are both avid gamers, both have been most of our adolescent and adult lives. We both have our own PC set ups in different rooms, we play together and with other people EVERY night nearly. We play every popular FPS game with each other (Fortnite, Call of Duty, you name it). 

On Call of Duty, the one and only Nicki Minaj is being added to the game as a purchasable and playable character, with her own visuals, voice lines by her, in game callouts and special moves. (Adding a photo to post for visuals). Her outfit is rather suggestive, large breasts and a pretty significant booty as well. I have been a fan of her since middle school, love all of her music, been to concerts even. 

I told him I wasn’t comfortable with him as my boyfriend buying the skin on his own account, because he doesn’t have the same affinity for Nicki as I do. He isn’t a fan of her music and doesn’t follow her as a celebrity on social media, doesn’t keep up with her at all. In his own words “I just want it because it’s Nicki Minaj.” But why do most men who have no actual appreciation for Nicki as an artist like her? Because of her physical ASS-ets.

Once I voiced that, he got upset with me because I called out his obvious reason as to why he wants the skin, to objectify her. He still pressed on saying “it’s my money I can buy it if I want to.” I then voiced that it makes me uncomfortable but i cannot control what he does or spends his money on. He then said he didn’t want to make me uncomfortable, and dropped the convo. Then a few hours later asked again if he could get the skin, and i didn’t want to have another disagreement, and said we can talk later.

I don’t give him a hard time about Fortnite girl skins he has or other games, as they’re very cartoon-y and don’t resemble a real person, like COD does.

 I as a female, and a fan of Nicki, want to purchase the skin on my own because its incredibly empowering to have strong female roles in video games and makes me as a woman proud to see it. 

I am aware this is a super niche issue, and I know how it might seem small, but it’s something I would interact with virtually every day, so it would bother me every time I saw it.

"AITA for expecting my niece to give some kind of notice before she comes over, or at least knock?","My husband, sons (6, 10, 12), and I are visiting my husband's family until school starts in 2.5 weeks. We are staying with my MIL. 

My niece (19) is very close with her grandma and is here all the time. I was told she'll be here every Wednesday for lunch. I did not expect to wake up and see my niece having coffee in the living room, have her and her boyfriend over for dinner nearly every night, and have her run in at random times throughout the day because she was hungry or needed to use the bathroom and MIL's house is closer than her apartment. She eats the snacks I buy for the boys, which my MIL always excuses because she's used to having free rein of the kitchen, and I think she's even been using my pads. 

It wouldn't be that big of a problem if she ever called before she came over, or if she even knocks, but she has a key to the house and feels that she doesn't need to give notice before she comes over. Her being here and taking all of my MIL's attention while she's here means my boys don't get much time with their grandma. We go out during the day, MIL never wants to join us, and niece is always here during mornings and evenings. 

I tried to talk to MIL about asking niece to knock before she comes in or call beforehand to let us know because I feel that our right to privacy is not being respected but MIL refused, saying niece had just as much, if not more, of a right to be here as we do. I told her that niece will be fine at her own apartment for a couple weeks and now she's ignoring us. She only cooks for herself, niece, and niece's boyfriend and refuses to talk to me.

AITA for the way I reacted with my best friend's husband ?,"I (26F) have been friend with Celia (26F) for about 10 years now. 

She got married with her husband Mike (27M) a year ago. Me and Mike get along well, he's a nice dude and he seems to treat her well.

Yesterday evening Celia, Mike and I were all invited to a friend's party to celebrate some good news. I don't drink alcohol but Mike got quite drunk and Celia drank only a little. 

I was wearing a short dress with heels and at some point Mike, completely drunk and laughing with other friends pulled my dress up and started commenting on my underwear.

I honestly just brushed it off because he was really drunk and doesn't behave like that normally. I said ""well let's see how he'll react when he gets sober"" and laughed. 

Celia wasn't happy at all but for some reason she started to yell at me that I should have reacted differently and how can I let him do that. She even said ""did you like it or what?"" and I didn't like that comment at all.

I told her that he's completely drunk so it's no big deal and if there's someone she should be mad at it's not me. I left not long after that.

I don't think I reacted badly but idk AITA here ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h873n/aita_for_the_way_i_reacted_with_my_best_friends/,200,2.8,71.4
AITA for making one of the chores the kids do about “mental load”,"I’ll keep this short, we have three kids and when they turn 12 I start making one of their chores about finding something to do. For example, make your bed, dishes away, and find a chore. So the kid will look around the house and find a chore it can be anything.

Really did this to teach them to see if something is dirty or needs fix and they can go and do it without needed instruction. Sometimes the kid pick something small like vacuum a rug, other times they pick something not realizing how big the task is, reorganizing the game room for example. Anyways it teaches them to figure out what needs done and then do it.

Overall my oldest kid took her only a little bit to do this. My son just turned 12 and he is struggling, I’m trying to get him to understand. He got so frustrated today that he couldn’t see what needed to be done in the house that he locked himself in his room. Tried to have him write a list of what he though could be cleaned in the living room (did not work)

My husband is pissed that I am giving them “mental load” chores and called me an ass. We had an argument and really I am just trying to help their problem-solving skills

Edit 

Omg, just because he is indecisive doesn’t make him have ADHD or anything, stop with blanket statements. Also yes we had him tested. Some people are just more cautious, yes indecisiveness is a symptom but he has basically no others and was tested.

Some people are just indecisive, could be for thousands of reason like lack of confidence, wanting to have things perfect and so on.  Not everything is ADHD",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h6xv8/aita_for_making_one_of_the_chores_the_kids_do/,200,3.6,55.6
"AITA for telling the family about my brother's lewd comment, which led to him being shunned?","I’m in a predicament and need some outside perspectives. I (F25) have a close relationship with my brother (M27) despite our occasional disagreements typical of siblings.

The issue took place last weekend during a family gathering. We were all enjoying each other's company when my brother made a lewd comment about my appearance. It was entirely inappropriate and not the kind of remark you'd expect a brother to make about his sister.

I immediately asked him to retract his words. He merely laughed it off, insisting it was a joke and telling me to lighten up. The rest of the family looked visibly uncomfortable but remained silent.

After the gathering, I decided to confront him privately, reiterating that his comment was unacceptable. However, he stood by his 'joke' and claimed I was overreacting. He said it was just regular sibling banter.

Feeling the need to stand up for myself, I informed the rest of the family about his behavior and the specific comment he made. I believed they had a right to know why there was tension between us.

The fallout was immediate. Many family members were appalled by his remark, and he has since been shunned from family activities until he apologizes and demonstrates understanding about why his comment was wrong.

Now, my parents are claiming that I'm causing unnecessary drama and strain in the family by sharing what happened. They think I should have just shrugged it off because ""boys will be boys"" and that he didn't mean anything by it.

So here I am, feeling like I've done the right thing, yet facing backlash from my family.

AITA for 'disrespecting cultural and religious traditions'?,"Hey Reddit! I never thought I'd be posting here, but I need some unbiased opinions on a situation I'm dealing with. I (28f, Hindu) am about to marry my fiancé(29m, Christian)  in the US. We're really excited about our upcoming wedding, which will have both a Christian and Hindu ceremony to honor both our Religious backgrounds. However, I'm currently having a major conflict with my future MIL (F50s) over the color of my wedding dress for my Christian ceremony.

In Hinduism, white clothes are traditionally associated with mourning and funerals, so they're not considered appropriate for occasions like weddings. I've explained this religious significance to my MIL, telling her why I'm uncomfortable wearing a white gown for my Christian ceremony. She  accused me of disrespecting cultural values.

My MIL even went ahead and demanded that I wear her wedding dress, completely disregarding my feelings. She insists I wear it to show respect for her family's traditions. I've tried to compromise by suggesting wearing an off-white or a light pink gown, which I would be more comfortable wearing. But she immediately shut down that option and insisted on her choice.

I feel guilty because my family and I have a complete say about all the Hindu ceremonies (the wedding, sangeet, mehendi, etc.), but my fiancés family is only organizing the Christian ceremony on the day of the wedding. My fiancé is also doing all that is done by a groom in a traditional Hindu wedding (which is quite a lot more than what I am expected), so should I compromise on this one thing?

My fiancé's a bit mad at his mom and told her to cut it out repeatedly, but she always finds a way to bring it up again mostly when I'm alone with her.

I'm not trying to undermine MIL's cultural traditions, but I also want my wedding day to reflect who I am and what I believe in.

AITA for making my baby laugh at a restaurant,"It was my wife's birthday yesterday.  She picked out a mid tier restaurant to go to for her birthday.  This was no chili's level but not high end either.  We went at 5:30 on a Wednesday, so not that busy.  

We have a 10 month old who's just about the happiest kid ever.  Nearly anything I do makes him laugh. Well at dinner I was making him laugh.  He'd throw in some happy yelling.  Maybe got a touch loud but he was in a great mood. 

Well the table next to us had an issue with what I was doing and asked me to stop.  They told us to keep it down.  I'm like he's laughing thats all.  Him laughing is an issue?  They just repeat that he is too loud, if he is going to be like this they suggested we stay home.  I tell them to leave us alone and continue making my son laugh.  I overheard them reference me as an asshole.  They requested to move tables and did.  But was I the asshole for making my baby laugh?  

Edit: This was a 3-5 minute interaction with my son while waiting for the check.  It was 90% giggling.  The other Hour plus we were there it was just him being quiet or eating or going bahbahbah over and over.  There was no extended shrieking at all that occurred.
